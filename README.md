# SmolPlayer
This is a very nice, super lightweight Youtube music player, forked from:

https://github.com/Str8cucked/SmolPlayer

https://github.com/noahbroyles/SmolPlayer

It needed some Raspberry Pi support, which is why this fork exists. Still, this should be platform-agnostic enough for people to enjoy it, no matter their system.

Note that there might be some features that no longer work; this affects the original versions too.
There are others that have been "resurrected", like searching on the 'url entry' bar.
If you are missing something, please let me know.

Thanks to the original authors.
