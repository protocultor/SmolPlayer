# SmolPlayer
- - - -
This is a very nice, super lightweight Youtube music player, forked from:

https://github.com/Str8cucked/SmolPlayer

https://github.com/noahbroyles/SmolPlayer

It needed some Raspberry Pi support, which is why this fork exists. Still, this should be platform-agnostic enough for people to enjoy it, no matter their system.

Note that there are some features that no longer work, like searching for music from inside the app; this affects the original versions too.

If you have any problems outside these, please let me know.

Thanks to the original authors.
